# Backend for Agents SDK (BFA)

A generic and opinionated framework and SDK to implement the **BFA (Backend for Agents)** pattern, featuring native support for **FAISS-based Semantic Routing (vector search)** and standard abstractions for A2A Agents and MCP Servers.

Designed to extend and upgrade the traditional keyword-based BM25 router by leveraging semantic vector embeddings to resolve tools and agents dynamically.

## BFA Protocol Architecture

The BFA Gateway acts as a semantic middleware layer between consumers (e.g. messaging UIs, chat systems) and specialized agents/tools.

    end

```

## Key Features

1. **FAISS-Based Semantic Routing:** Instead of matching exact keywords (like BM25), the BFA Gateway indexes the descriptions, tags, and examples of agents and tools in a local FAISS vector index. This resolves queries to matching functions even when synonyms are used (e.g. matching *"plastic"* to *"credit card"*).
2. **`BFAAgent` Abstraction:** Simplifies building A2A agents using the `a2a-sdk` and Starlette. Forces standard metadata declarations (`tags`, `examples`, `description`) required for semantic indexing.
3. **`BFAMCP` Abstraction:** Wraps and extends `FastMCP` servers. Automatically exposes a standardized `/tools` endpoint returning input schemas, descriptions, and custom tags/examples for discovery.
4. **Serverless (AWS Lambda) Ready:** Includes a built-in **Mangum** adapter in the Gateway. Combined with the cloud-based `OpenAIEmbedder`, the BFA Gateway runs serverless on demand with zero cold-starts.

## Quick Start & Running the Demo

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional: install in editable development mode
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Run the MDBank Demo
The demo launches three mock servers in the background:
1. A mock MDBank MCP server (`examples/mock_mdbank_mcp.py`) on port `8001`.
2. A mock Cuentas A2A Agent (`examples/mock_cuentas_agent.py`) on port `8002`.
3. A mock Tarjetas A2A Agent (`examples/mock_tarjetas_agent.py`) on port `8003`.
4. The BFA Gateway on port `8000`, running dynamic discovery and performing test queries.

To run:
```bash
python examples/run_demo.py
```

### 3. Run the UI Dashboard (IRC-A Central Hub)
We have included a React-based UI Dashboard under `examples/frontend` to visually monitor the active agents/tools registry, register new microservices dynamically (plug-and-play), and chat with the routed banking agents:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd examples/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```
Open `http://localhost:3000` to interact with your local agent hub in real-time.

## Credits & Acknowledgements

This SDK is a community-driven implementation and expansion of the **BFA (Backend for Agents)** architectural pattern originally designed and documented by **Michael Douglas Barbosa Araujo** (Staff AI Architect). 

You can read his original article introducing the pattern here:
👉 [O padrão Back-end para Agentes (BFA) - Medium](https://medium.com/@mdbaraujo/o-padr%C3%A3o-back-end-para-agentes-bfa-a53c1c6d87fb)

The goal of this project is to provide a standardized, packaged SDK extending his original concept with semantic vector routing (FAISS) and unified base adapters. All credit for the underlying protocol and architectural vision belongs to him.
